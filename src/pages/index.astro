      <p>
        I’m a builder at heart. Over the past two decades, I’ve had the privilege of working on foundational
        technologies—
        from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_ActiveSync" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">ActiveSync</a>,

        and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">Windows</a> at Microsoft,
        to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          class="text-blue-600 underline hover:text-blue-800">Marketplace at Meta</a>,
        and more recently, <a href="https://www.nightfall.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"

      <p>My career has taken me from Morocco to the heart of Silicon Valley, and I’ve learned that the most meaningful
        progress happens when deep technology meets human empathy. I’m driven by impact—solving problems that matter, at
        scale.</p>
      <p>I’ve led product and engineering teams in large companies, currently learning and enjoying the thrills of small
        startups. I have learned from and collaborated with incredible people along the way. Above
        all, I consider myself a hands-on builder and a lifelong learner, energized by what’s next and grounded in the
        belief that big things
        start small.</p>
      <p>Whether mentoring, building, or investing, I aim to empower others to lead boldly, build wisely, and never wait
        for permission to make a difference.</p>

      <p>I love creating innovative solutions, that leverage the latest technologies, to solve the World's most
        meaningful and complex problems.

        I’m passionate about working with founders and builders who are not afraid to take risks, embrace uncertainty,
        and challenge the status quo. I believe that the best products are built by teams that are not only technically
        skilled but also deeply empathetic to their users’ needs.</p>
      <p>My goal is to help founders and builders navigate the complexities of product development, from ideation to
        execution. I’m here to share my experience, insights, network, and capital to help you succeed in your journey.
        I’m particularly interested in working with early-stage startups that are focused on building products that have
        a positive impact on society at large, Morocco and Africa in particular.</p>

        <p>I started writing publicly to reflect on the journey that
          shaped me — from Morocco to Microsoft, from engineering to leadership, and from quietly building to mentoring
          and giving back.</p>
        <p>This blog isn’t about being an expert. It’s about being real. I believe that sharing our stories — especially
          the messy, in-between parts — helps others feel less alone, and reminds us that growth isn’t linear.</p>
        <p>Whether you're an aspiring engineer, a founder figuring things out, or simply someone who’s ever felt like
          they
          didn’t quite belong, I hope you’ll find something here that resonates.</p>
        <p>My only goal is to contribute with intention. And if even one post helps someone take their next step with
          confidence, then it’s already worth it.</p>

      <p>
        I believe that sometimes, all it takes is a quick conversation to unlock a fresh perspective, open a door, or
        give someone the confidence to keep going. I’ve been lucky to learn from people who generously shared their time
        and insights — and I’d love to do the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether you're exploring your next step, building something new, or just curious about how things work, I'm here
        for it. If my experience navigating tech, startups, or making an impact resonates with where you’re headed,
        don’t hesitate to reach out.
      </p>

      <p>
        No pressure. No ego. Just a conversation with someone who’s been in your shoes and wants to help where it makes
        sense.
